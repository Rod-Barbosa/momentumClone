## Overview

### The challenge

A game of war: Each player draws a card, highest value wins. At the end of the deck, the player with most points winds

Users should be able to Code/Understand:

- CALLBACKS
- Functions as first-class objects
- Built own .filter()
- PROMISES
- Three states(pensing, fullfiled, rejected)
- .then() and chaining
- WAR
- Deck of Cards API
- Styling & Layout
- Algorithms
- UX improvements
- ASYNC/AWAIT

- May hte next one do a better job at translating a browser extension into a website. 
- If you want to install and see how it works, click the github link, download the files, open your google chrome extensions and point the downloads folder. It should do the trick.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### What I learned

CSS has a calc function, that spares me the job of doing math/ adjust values dynamicly
```css
calculating dimensions for a5/7 ratio card
div.card-slot {
    border: 1px solid black;
    border-radius: 5px;
    height: 120px;
    width: calc(120px * 5 / 7);
}
```

Other than :hover and :focus, :disabled also exists as a pseudo-class
```css
button:disabled {
    cursor: not-allowed;
}

```


### Continued development

I could make a version with discard piles, with drawing 3 cards at a time for each player... closer to a real world game of WAR. Who knows? The future is the future

### Useful resources

- [Json lint](https://jsonlint.com/) - for validating json, make sure it is all correct
- [JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) - to read fetch options object body property correctly, you got to JSON.stringigy()â€¦ JSON in all caps, not json like in the res handling
- [Disable Button with Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_pushbutton_disabled.asp) - When disabling a button, remember to make cursor: not-allowed; for the dramatic effect
- [Array of DOMElement's children](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/children) - A DOMElement's childrens are proving more and more usefull
